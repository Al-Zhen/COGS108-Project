    "  In sports, the concept of home advantage refers to the benefit that the home team is said to have over the visiting team. For instance, if a game takes place in city A, team A from city A is said to have a home advantage when playing against team B from city B. Some believe that home teams have advantages over visiting teams in both the psychological and the physical aspect. Due to physical proximity, audiences of the game are more likely to be fans of the home team.Physically, the visiting team often faces challenges such as adjusting to different time zones, unfamiliar environments, and unique stadium conditions. These factors are believed to contribute to the advantages for home teams, potentially impacting the game’s outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In a study done by Barry and Barsky<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), it is shown that home game advantage varies across different sports. Hockey and basketball shows the most significant differences, meaning that the home team has the most significant advantage. On the other hand, home teams of football games has a smaller advantage while home teams of baseball has the least advantage over the visiting team compared to other sports. Furthermore, in this study, the authors reached the conclusion that other factors, such as audience support, play a role in the effectiveness of home game advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In another study done by Harville and Smith<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), the effects of home game advantages on college basketball teams were analyzed. The authors concluded that the estimated benefit of playing at home is about 4.68 points, and this advantage is approximately the same across different teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Other studies have shown the effects of home game advantages across different sports. For example, in the study done by Nevill et al.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), major team sports are shown to be positively impacted by the home game advantage. In American football, of the 2592 games analyzed, the home winning percentage is 57.3%. On the other hand, in ice hockey, the home winning percentage is 59.5%. Soccer shows an even higher home winning rate of 63.9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In a blog post “Is there a home-game advantage in professional sport?”<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4), written by Peter Hersh,  the home-game advantages of MLB (Major League Baseball), NBA (National Basketball Association), NFL (National Football League), and NHL (National Hockey League) over the past decade are analyzed. Based on the analysis, all 4 sports show an advantage when the games are played at home. Overall, MLB shows the smallest advantage compared to other sports. During the year of the pandemic, however, MLB shows the greatest home advantage compared to the other team sports.\n",

    " After excluding the factors not related to the home-field advantage, we expect that MLB teams have a far larger winning rate when playing in their home stadium compared to away, with the magnitude of that home-field advantage varying between teams based on factors such as fan support, travel distance, and familiarity with playing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanations:\n",
    " We expect teams to be performing better at home because of the psychological benefits of fan support, less travel fatigue, and field conditions. Also, shorter travel times and no jet lag will help players to perform much better than when playing in a visiting game. This hypothesis is inspired by substantial evidence in sports psychology and player metrics indicating that home-field advantage is one of the main players in team performance."

Each number is set so that “100” is average for that metric, and the park-specific number is generated by looking at each batter and pitcher, controlled by handedness, and comparing the frequency of that metric in the selected park compared to the performance of those players in other parks.\n",
    "For example, the 135 HR mark for 2018-2020 at Great American Ball Park does not mean the Reds hit 35% more home runs at their home park. It means for batters and pitchers who played both at GABP and elsewhere, 35% more home runs were observed at GABP.\""

While this form of data is publicly accessible, there could be some bias in the overrepresentation of certain teams, seasons, or players. The privacy issues would be minimal, as this data involves professional athletes and publicly held games; therefore, much of the statistics and game information would be in the public domain.
